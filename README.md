# Note W3C markup validation
This code returns a <label> error in W3C checkers. This is due to the fact that label can't be parent of <div> nor <nav>.
Anyway, checkbox can only be checked in label does englobe.
As I wasn't able to use provided JS code, this error is currently made on purpose.
Let's hope this count as 1x error (as it is always the same) ;-)
